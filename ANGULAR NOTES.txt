ANGULAR NOTES
 to check versions in command prompt,open cmd and type version
 to check version of node js,type node -v (or)ng version (or)ng v
 npm install -g @angular/cli
(cli)=command line interface
 to check version npm--version
 to check version of vs code type (npm --version)
 npm=node packager manager
 it is a client server
 it is a type script server
 transpiling means it will convert type script to java script 
 system understand only java script
 data types in angular
    1.boolean
     2.string
      3.numbers
explicit,implicit
  explicit=we can't add values directly instad we can add with variables,and string
  implicit=we want to add within string and use with function
like data types we will write any,unknown.
any means we will through error,in unknown it will acess value but it will not through error

1.INTRODUCTION TO ANGULAR
2.SPA
3.FEATURES OF ANGULAR

 type script is a super script of java script
 it was introduced by microsoft office
 in java we have prototypes,dynamic types,constructor function
 type script is strongly typed but in java scripe it not
 let is a keyword in angular,it declares as variable.
 ARRAY[]
 array is a kind of lists to allocate some memory spaces or blocks
 ex:var student_name :string[];
 student_name=['sushma', 'dharani','sangeetha']
           (0)       (1)       (2)
 back side it will run like
 student_name [0]->sushma
              [1]->dharani
              [2]->sangeetha
 console.log(student_name[0],'student');
 in angular we want to terminal values use(console.log)
 functions in array[]
 concat(),  every(), filter(),  foreach(),  join(),  lastindex(),  map(),  push(),  reduce(),  reduce right(),
 reverse(),  shift(),  slice(),  some(),  sort(),  to string(),  unshift().


 to run program open terminal node <file_name>.js
 in visual stidio code tsc <file_name>.tsc
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 today topic:properties
             methods
			 constructors
#these three are variables we use in function, we define in a class.
it intilaiae the properties of a object
1)PROPERTIES:
claas_student{
       name : string
	   roll no : numbers
	   }
Constructor(name:stringmroll no: number)
          {
		  name : this name;
		  roll no: this roll no;
		  }
		  this addition();
2)methods:
       these are the methods which use the class functions in the codes 
	   class addition{
	   }
3)constructors:
            these are the intialize the properties of aobject
			this addition();
			count std = new student();
			
			constuctor = (name : string,roll no : number)
			{
			  Name : this name;
			  Roll no : this roll no;
			}
			
#new is the key word in this propeties.
#properties define the characterstics attributes of an object created from the class.
#method  functions defined within acclass,
  it define the behaviour of the class and can operate the class properties.
 #constructors:it is called when object is created from class wing new().
		  
 #difference betwwen var and let with examples.

--------------------------TODAY CLASS--------------------------------------------
1.local variable:
we have to use variable within function only ,we can use let in locla variable but we cant use var in local variable.
2.global variable:
we have to use variable in outside the function in global variable we cant use let keyword but we can use var in global variable.

example for local variable:
function fita()
 {
 let a = 10;
 }
 example for global variable:
 var a;
 function fita()
 {
 return a;
  }
  function(){
  a
  }
 3.inheritance we can use in class after.it is like blue print.
 4.extends is the keyword in inheritence.
 5. we can derive from parent class as blue print and we can use in others clasess.
 6. in inheritence we have base class and derived class.
 TYPES OF INHERITENCES:
 1.single inheritence
 2.multilevel inheritence
 3.multiple inheritence
 4.hierarchial inheritance
 5.hybrid inheritence
 6.type script supports only single and multilevel inheritence it not support multiple,hierarchial and hybrid inheritence.
   ->in single class inheritance it has parentclass and derived.
   ->for multilevel inheritence has more than one parent class(grand father,father and child).
   ->for multiple inheritence it acquries the properties from more than one parent class.
   ->for hirarchial inheritance more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class.
   ->for hybrid inheritence it is a combination of multilevel and multiple inheritence.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEXT TOPIC:Access Modifiers
 1.public
 2.private
 3.protected
 ->in protected if we define only it shows in private it menas it shows in within var but it not show in public.
 example for protected using extends key word
  class car{
  public color: string;
  }
  if we take  as sample because it is in public.
  class sample{
  this.color = 'pink';
   }
   ->we can use keyword extendsclass fita extends car{
   console.log('');
   this.prize = 1000;
   }
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TODAY CLASS:29/10/23
 1.Static Methods:
 ->keyword is static in typescript.
 ->in static it is constant only not change.
   class num{
   static square(num:number){
     return num;
	}
    }
 ->Topic want to show in vs code Calculator Application.
 
 Topic:Interfaces
 ->interface it should be in within class only.
 example:
     interface fita academy{
	 
	 student_name: string;
	 batch_no : number;
	 techonologies : string;
	 completion status? : string; -->optional
	 read only we given means it allows to read but not to modify.
	 
	 
	 const academy:fita academy{
	 student_name : 'sushma';
	 batch_no : 5;
	 techonologies : 'angular';
	 }
	 }

	 ANGULAR:
	 ->in angular component means html,css,ts,specs.ts.
	 
	 COMMANDS IN ANGULAR:
	 
	 ->ng build = compiles an angular application into an output directory.
	 ->ng serve = builds and serve your application, rebuilding on file changes.
	 ->ng generate = generates or modifies files based on a schematic.
	 ->ng test = runs unit test on a given project.
	 ->ng e2e = builds and serves an angular application, then runs end-to-end tests.
	 
	  UNDERSTANDING ANGULAR:
	  
	 ->components
	 ->templates
	 ->directives
	 ->dependency injection.

TODAY:11/5/23
TOPIC:FRAMEWORK,LIBRARY
framework:
->it will use in frontend
->it was developed by google
->it was component based architecture
    _____dependency injection 
	_____services
	
framework types:
 ->core angular framework
 eg:components,
      services,
	  dependency injection.
	 
 ->testing framework:
 eg:jasmine,
    karma,
	protector.
	

library :
->resuable code modules or
  structure----->angular application
->ngrx,rxjs,prime ng

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRUCTURE OF MVC IN ANGULAR
->it applies both client &server side.
 mvc ->model, view, controller.
   MVC
   ->model it has data structures,
                       logics.
					   
   ->view it has html,
                 dom elemnt
   ->controller it has model and view (userprint)
   
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-
ELEMENTS IN ANGULAR
-->We wnt to angular start we want to use app module.
1)modules
   in that we havecomponents like
                                html,
								css,
								typescript,
								specs.ts.
					 in modules all want to generate means module.ts  
		it has routing module.
		

TOPIC:DATABINDING IN ANGULAR
  1)INTERPOLATION {{}}                                           (HTML)
  2)PROPERTY BINDING []                                          <INPUT [VALUE] = "USERNAME">
  3)EVENT BINDING()                                               <DIV (CLICK) = ONCLICK()>
  4)TWO-WAY DATA BINDING[()]                                       <INPUT [(NGMODEL)] -"USERNAME">
  5)CLASS BINDING [CLASS.ACTIVE]

  7)ATTRIBUTE BINDING [ATTR]
  
  
TEMPLATES::
  ->structural directives
     1)ngfor
	 2)ngif
	 
TEMPLATE VARIABLES::
 ->we can use (#) in variables
   <input #myinput .txt>
   in that myipnput means id.
   
 METADATA::
 we can use(@) to define matadata.
 it will use to define a component,modulus, and directives.

 .to fixed()
 value of()
 number
 parseint
 parsefolat
 number.parse int
 number.parse float
 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 1)array methods:
 pop()means it exclude(delete) the value in array[]
